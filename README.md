## Project Deliverable for ITCS 3160

## Project Contents

Introduction (Team, Project Description)
For this project our team will be constructing a test database for a campus controlled food delivery service similar to craveoncampus.com.
The goal is to have a robust database that can connect approved drivers to students on UNCC's campus and deliver them food to predetermined locations. 
We will be starting with a database from the "Mavericks" group and improving on it by making it more efficient and by also adding a rating system which 
wasn't currently in the database. We hope that with this database will provide us will valuable information about the eating habits on campus and can help improve
the campus food delivery service. The user orders food.The user pays amount Restarant gets the order. Driver gets the location of the order and where to drop it off. Driver picks up food and drops to off to the user. 

Use Case for Rating System
